This is a stock trading game that I wrote when I was just learning how to write Python. I've uploaded this program because I thought it was cool and it generally seems to run. The latest commit in this branch is a port of the original game to a version that could be played in the web browser. Seeing as I was learning the Flask microframework at the time, I decided that this was obviously the way to go.
As such, previous commits are of some interest. Just a few commits before the latest one on this branch, you'll find my early experiences with creating and using objects. If you go far enough back, you'll find a command line based version of the game, instead of the GUI and web-based versions you'll encounter later on.
